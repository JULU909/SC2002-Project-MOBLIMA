As an overwhelming terror begins taking over her life, Rose must confront her troubling past in order to survive and escape her horrifying new reality.",Parker Finn,"Sosie Bacon, Jessie T. Usher, Kyle Gallner, Robin Weigert",4,"Deeply creepy visuals and a standout Sosie Bacon further elevate Smile's unsettling exploration of trauma, adding up to the rare feature that satisfyingly expands on a short.","It could have been the kind of sinister flick that follows you home, slipping through the door, up the stairs, and curling up deep inside your head, daring you to sleep. Instead, Smile feels as disposable as a candy wrapper.",Catnip for teens venturing out to the multiplex with friends on a Friday night.,"R",Horror/Mystery & thriller,1h 55m
3,HellRaiser,Now Showing,"A new take on Clive Barker's 1987 horror classic in which a young woman struggling with addiction comes into possession of an ancient puzzle box, unaware that its purpose is to summon the Cenobites, a group of sadistic supernatural beings from another dimension.",David Bruckner,"Jamie Clayton, Pinhead , Goran Visnjic , Odessa A'Zion , Hiam Abbass",3,"A gift for long-suffering fans after numerous subpar sequels, David Bruckner's Hellraiser unlocks the puzzle box for getting this franchise back on the right track",,,R,Horror/Mystery & thriller,2h 0m
4,Bros,Now Showing,"From the ferocious comic mind of Billy Eichner (Billy on the Street, 2019's The Lion King, Difficult People, Impeachment: American Crime Story) and the hitmaking brilliance of filmmakers Nicholas Stoller (the Neighbors films, Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and Judd Apatow (The King of Staten Island, Trainwreck, The Big Sick), comes Bros, a smart, swoony and heartfelt comedy about finding sex, love and romance amidst the madness.",Nicholas Stoller,"Billy Eichner , Luke MacFarlane , Ts Madison , Monica Raymund",5,"Bros marks a step forward in rom-com representation -- and just as importantly, it's a whole bunch of fun to watch.","The lines that do sing are wonderful and the direction by Nicholas Stoller is smart and pacey. It’s just not, well, all that.","Eichner, as co-writer, mixes in enough queer humor and insight to please fans and educate others. Pay attention, the one-liners and social consciousness observations are hurled at you non-stop.",R,Romance/Comedy,1h 55m

Only one of them will survive.",David Gordon Green,"Jamie Lee Curtis, Andi Matichak, Will Patton, James Jude Courtney, Rohan Campbell, Kyle Richards",2,"It's easy to admire its wide swings at doing something different with a trilogy closer, but Green and his team can’t figure out how to wed their undeniable ambition to something that’s coherent.","One could excuse the lack of scares had the writers done something out of the ordinary with this closing chapter. Instead, we are left with a case of “let’s throw everything at the story but the kitchen sink and see what sticks“.","The climax of Halloween Ends is pure, unabashed, blood-soaked nonsense, culminating in that full-throttle showdown that’s been 44 years in the making and promised in the sequel’s title.",M18,Holiday/Horror,1h 51m

It was a step down from the first two seasons and the ending was disjointed from the previous 100 chapters.,"The movie itself is enjoyable, you won't get bored, but some parts feel rushed or meaningless. For example, the biological father of the sisters sudden appears to meet with Itsuki, saying he is her real father. That was really forced and it felt very dry. Why he was there? Why that moment? He had less than 5 min of screen time, and it ended just as a bad old guy without any emotion, I couldn't see any reason for this encounter to happen in the movie, it didn't add anything on the story.",NIL,PG-13,Anime,2h 16m

Russell,"Christian Bale, Robert De Niro, Margot Robbie, Zoe Saldana, Anna Taylor-Joy, Rami Malek , Mike Myers, Taylor Swift",3,"Amsterdam has a bunch of big stars and a very busy plot, all of which amounts to painfully less than the sum of its dazzling parts.","May “Amsterdam” ’s melodramatic sentimentality be forgiven; not many films of such exuberance, since the time of Chaplin, have been fuelled by such rage.","In the same way that its bloated cast becomes a distraction which takes you out of the story, Amsterdam is unnecessarily convoluted, twisting its confusing narrative into a cobra knot",NC-16,Comedy/Mystery & thriller,2h 14m

From Working Title, Smokehouse Pictures and Red Om Films, Ticket to Paradise is a romantic comedy about the sweet surprise of second chances.",Ol Parker,"George Clooney, Julia Roberts",4,"The tension between the two leads is by far the most entertaining aspect of the film. Nobody would pretend that we are getting sparring to compare with Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant, but both actors know how to bristle convincingly.","Clooney and Roberts are on form. This is exactly the genre in which they can dial up their charms to 12 and distract you from the fact that the movie itself is generic, predictable and loses momentum about midway through.","In the end, we don’t really care about these characters enough to be fully invested in their potential reconciliation. And why should we? They aren’t very likable in the first place.",PG-13,Romance/Comedy,1h 44m
